# DS-related
For career exploring, I took a DS course in spring. There are things needed to be recorded.  
Most about questions I ask ChatGBT. There would **not** homework solutions provided.  

## SQL related
Would be moved to [The branch in the Beginning-of-Codes: DS-related/SQL](https://github.com/HeathersCodes/Beginning-of-Codes/tree/DS-related/SQL)

## Pyspark/Hadoop/Hive
Cloud-based parallel computing with Google Cloud Platform.  
Would be moved to [The branch in the Beginning-of-Codes: DS-related/tools-in-big-data](https://github.com/HeathersCodes/Beginning-of-Codes/tree/DS-related/tools-in-big-data)

[Intro to Pyspark (First Two Chapters done, other two are optional)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-pyspark/getting-to-know-pyspark).   
[Pyspark SQL](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-spark-sql-in-python/pyspark-sql).   


### Feb 21
[Cleaning Data with Pyspark](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-with-pyspark/dataframe-details).   
A little bit tricky for beginner.

## Stat


## Optional
[Data Manipulation with pandas](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas)   
The PDF would be move to [BasicPandas](https://github.com/HeathersCodes/DS-related/tree/main//cleche/BasicPandas)
Pretty easy but tedious. Good way to review the skill of **grouping and aggregating data by stat method**, **sorting**, **(indexing(and set index, reset even drop the index) and subsetting) by bool condition or method (.iloc .loc)**, **visualizing**, **read and save to csv file in Pandas**...
